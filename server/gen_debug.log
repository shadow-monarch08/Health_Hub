C:\Users\narendra\Desktop\documents\web Development Programming\Health Hub\server\node_modules\@prisma\client exists and is not empty but doesn't look like a generated Prisma Client. Please check your output path and remove the existing directory if you indeed want to generate the Prisma Client in that location.
